The Directional data is written in three files: 

- Angles: contains the directions. 
   * The 1st row gives the observation zenith  angles
   * The 2nd row gives the observation azimuth angles
   * The 3rd row gives the solar       zenith  angles

- Temperatures: contains the directional brightness temperature. 
   * The 1st column gives the wl values corresponding to the brightness temperature values (except for broadband)
   * The 2nd column gives the Tb values corresponding to the directions given by first column in the Angles file

- BRDF: contains the bidirectional distribution functions values. 
   * The 1st column gives the wl values corresponding to the BRDF values
   * The 2nd column gives the BRDF values corresponding to the directions given by first column in the Angles file
