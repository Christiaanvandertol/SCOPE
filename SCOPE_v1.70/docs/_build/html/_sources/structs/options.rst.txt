Options
========

Simulation options, such as time series or look-up tables, fluorescence.

The values have binary (or tertiary) logic thus equal to 0 or 1 (or 2).

Influence on the output files is highlighted in the corresponding section :ref:`output_files:Output files`

.. Note:: Not all combinations are possible

``SCOPE.m``: read from ``input_data.xlsx`` or ``setoptions.m``


Effects
""""""""""

:func:`.RTMo` (SAIL) is executed in any valid run. Other functions may be executed with this options.


``calc_ebal``
--------------

Switch in ``SCOPE.m``

**0**


    Only :func:`.RTMo` is run (with :func:`.RTMf` if ``options.calc_fluor``)

**1**

    Calculate the complete energy balance.

    .. Note:: thermal part of SCOPE is not possible without ``calc_ebal``

``calc_vert_profiles``
-----------------------

Calculation of vertical profiles (per 60 canopy layers).

Corresponding structure :ref:`structs/output/profiles:profiles`

Switch in ``SCOPE.m``, :func:`.RTMo` and :func:`.ebal`

**0**

    Profiles are not calculated

**1**
    | Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) per layer is calculated in :func:`.RTMo`
    | Energy, temperature and photosynthesis fluxes per layer are calculated in :func:`.ebal`
    | Fluorescence fluxes are calculated in :func:`.RTMf` if :ref:`.:calc_fluor`


``calc_fluor``
-----------------------

Calculation of fluorescence

Corresponding structure :ref:`structs/output/profiles:profiles`

Switch in ``SCOPE.m``, :func:`.calc_brdf`

**0**

    Only total emitted fluorescence is calculated based on absorbed PAR (:ref:`structs/ouput/fluxes:fluxes`.aPAR_Cab_eta), fluorescence quantum yield efficiency at photosystem level (:ref:`structs/input/leafbio:leafbio`.fqe), and specific absorption coefficient of photosystems (:ref:`structs/constants/optipar:optipar`.phi)

**1**
    | Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) per layer is calculated in :func:`.RTMo`
    | Energy, temperature and photosynthesis fluxes per layer are calculated in :func:`.ebal`
    | Fluorescence fluxes are calculated in :func:`.RTMf` if :ref:`options:calc_fluo`
