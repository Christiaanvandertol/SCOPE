Software requirements
========================

The model SCOPE_v1.70 is written in Matlab R2015b running on a Windows operating system. We took care not to use functions that are available in all recent Matlab versions, but we cannot give any warranty that it works under other operating systems and other Matlab versions.

.. warning::
    If you do not have Matlab on your computer you can use ``SCOPE.exe`` with `Matlab Runtime`_ **only R2015b (version 9.0)**
