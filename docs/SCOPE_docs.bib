abstract = {The vertical heterogeneity of leaf biophysical and biochemical properties may have a large effect on the bidirectional reflectance and fluorescence of vegetation canopies. This has implications for the interpretation of remote sensing data. We developed a model for light interaction and energy balance in vegetation canopies in which leaf biophysical and biochemical properties vary in the vertical. The model mSCOPE is an extension of the Soil-Canopy Observation of Photosynthesis and Energy fluxes (SCOPE) model, which simulates spectral and bidirectional reflectance, fluorescence, and photosynthesis of vertically heterogeneous vegetation canopies. The modelling of radiative transfer in mSCOPE is based on the classical SAIL theory. A solution to the radiative transfer equation for multi-layer canopies is given, which allows calculating top-of-canopy (TOC) reflectance and the flux profile. The latter is used for the simulation of fluorescence emission and photosynthesis of every leaf through the leaf radiative transfer model Fluspect and a biochemical model. The radiative transfer of fluorescence in multi-layer canopies is solved numerically in mSCOPE to obtain TOC bidirectional fluorescence. The significant effect of vertical heterogeneity of leaf properties on TOC reflectance, fluorescence and photosynthesis is demonstrated by different scenarios with customized vertical profiles of leaf chlorophyll content and leaf water content, and also with measured vertical profiles of leaf chlorophyll content in corn canopies. A preliminary validation of the reflectance calculating routine of mSCOPE is conducted by comparing measured and simulated TOC reflectance spectra of the corn canopies. We conclude that it is important to consider the vertical heterogeneity of leaf properties for the prediction of reflectance, fluorescence and photosynthesis. The model mSCOPE could serve as a tool to better understand vertically heterogeneous vegetation canopies.},

abstract = {The FLuorescence EXplorer (FLEX) satellite mission, selected as ESA's 8th Earth Explorer, has been designed for the measurement of sun-induced fluorescence (F) spectra emitted by plants. This will be accomplished through a multi-sensor approach by placing it in a common orbit in tandem with the Sentinel-3 (S3) mission, which will have two optical sensors on board, OLCI (Ocean and Land Colour Instrument) and SLSTR (Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer) to complement FLEX. These S3 instruments will be used in combination with the imaging spectrometers on board FLEX to provide data useful for atmospheric correction of FLEX data. However, a fully synergetic approach, i.e. by exploiting the spectral and directional information from all tandem mission instruments together, is an attractive alternative which is explored in this paper. By employing all combined top-of-atmosphere (TOA) spectral radiance data, one can (i) characterize the relevant optical properties of the atmosphere, (ii) retrieve biophysical canopy properties including the associated reflectance anisotropy, and (iii) retrieve a more accurate and consistent canopy F. Regarding retrieval methods, Fraunhofer Line Depth (FLD) and Spectral Fitting (SF) are well-known techniques applied to hyperspectral data. Both methods depend on a high spectral resolution and assume a Lambertian (isotropic) canopy reflectance. However, most vegetation canopies are non-Lambertian. This implies that, in particular when ignoring the anisotropic surface reflection, substantial retrieval errors can occur due to the interaction between atmospheric absorption bands and surface reflectance anisotropy. In this paper, a novel method based on spectral radiative transfer (RT) modeling is proposed, in which coupled RT models are used to simulate TOA radiance spectra. These are then matched with ‘measured' spectra in order to retrieve surface fluorescence, along with a suite of biophysical parameters, by model inversion through optimization. By applying coupled RT models of the soil-leaf-canopy and the surface-atmosphere systems, TOA radiance spectra can be simulated for all optical sensors of this tandem mission. In this way, complex effects due to surface reflectance anisotropy and the spectral sampling by the various instruments, which are difficult to compensate for in the end products, are properly taken into account by their incorporation in the forward modeling. Next, by model inversion of TOA radiance data via optimization, the most accurate F retrievals can be achieved in a consistent manner, along with important canopy level biophysical parameters that may help interpret the F spectrum, such as chlorophyll content and leaf area index (LAI). The potential of this approach has been explored in a numerical experiment, and the results are presented in this paper. We find that, with the assumed well-characterized and plausible FLEX/S3 instrument performances, the simultaneous retrieval of biophysical canopy parameters and F spectra would be possible with a remarkable accuracy, provided the correct atmospheric characterization is available.},

abstract = {The processing of remote-sensing data requires simple but accurate models of directional reflectance of the vegetation canopy. In this study, a reflectance model for a homogeneous canopy is evaluated over an extensive set of radiometric measurements performed on sugar beet canopies. The model corresponds to the Scattering by Arbitrary Inclined Leaves (SAIL) model (Verhoef, 1984) in which the term for first order scattering is corrected for hot-spot and leaf specular reflectance. Leaf optical properties are calculated using the PROSPECT model (Jacquemond and Baret, 1990). Experimental data correspond to a two-year experiment and express a large variability of leaf area index, chlorophyll concentration and soil background optical properties. In the first data set, reflectance was measured about midday under vertical viewing in five optical Thematic Mapper bands. In the second data set, both vertical and oblique measurements (zenith angle 45°, four azimuth angles) were performed from sunrise to sunset in the three SPOT bands. Except for leaf cuticle reflectance, structure and optical variables were measured in the field or adjusted to field measurement, independently of reflectance calculations. Although the structure of sugar beet canopies departs strongly from a turbid medium, a good agreement with measurements was obtained in the case of vertical, north and south view directions. However, the model underestimated the measurements close to the hot-spot direction. In the near infrared, there was also some underestimation of canopy reflectance in the opposite direction to the hot-spot. Possible reasons for these differences are discussed.},

abstract = {Partitioning of excitation energy between photochemical quenching (PQ) and non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) processes is constantly adjusted in the leaf in order to preserve the photosynthetic energy balance. Adjustments in PQ and NPQ often result from a combination of different temporal components that can be simplified into reversible and sustained components. While reversible PQ and NPQ are relatively well understood, the controls behind the sustained components of PQ and NPQ, or the interaction between sustained and reversible NPQ, remain elusive. In this study, I used a full year of high-resolution chlorophyll fluorescence (ChlF) data obtained with a Monitoring-PAM fluorometer (Walz, Effeltrich, Germany) in needles of boreal Pinus sylvestris in situ to quantitatively analyse the dynamics and interaction between temporal components of NPQ and PQ and their control by the environment. To enable the estimation of sustained and reversible components of PQ and NPQ, a number of key ChlF parameters were reviewed and adapted to the analysis of long-term monitoring data. Overall, NPQ was drastically enhanced during winter via the accumulation of sustained NPQ in a process regulated by air temperature. Reversible NPQ retained some functionality even at temperatures well below zero and was not inhibited by the presence of sustained NPQ per se but by low temperatures alone. This suggests that temporal NPQ components co-operate in an additive rather than complementary fashion, conferring additional flexibility to the photoprotective role of NPQ. Finally, the potential of the sustained photochemical quenching parameter (qL(s) ) to track photoinhibition in situ was discussed.},

abstract = {Plant biologists, agronomists and breeders alike have been constantly facing challenges in narrowing genotype-phenotype gaps. Plant systems biology, as first recognized, seems to target those phenotypes at molecular, sub-cellular, or cellular levels. To emphasize the importance of bridging this gap for understanding and directionally modifying phenotypes relevant to the real-world challenges for agriculture, the concept `crop systems biology' seems more appropriate. This new concept acknowledges the complementarity of the roles of modern plant biology, traditional crop physiology and advanced crop modelling in improving yield and resource use efficiencies of major crops. As a first step, biochemical modules of photosynthesis and molecular marker-based quantitative trait locus information were incorporated into existing crop models. These case studies underline that current modelling shows promise in studying complex crop traits. For further progress, crop models should be upgraded based on understandings of complicated phenomena at lower organizational levels. We expect that this crop systems biology approach will ultimately be instrumental in realizing the expected roles of in silico modelling in narrowing genotype-crop phenotype gaps, and in understanding genotype-by-environment interactions at crop level.

@article{Collatz1992,
abstract = {Leaf based models of net photosynthesis (An) and stomatal conductance (g) are often components of whole plant, canopy and regional models of net primary productivity and surface energy balance. Since C4 metabolism shows unique responses to environmental conditions and C4 species are important agriculturally and ecologically, a realistic and accurate leaf model specific to C4 plants is needed. In this paper we develop a simple model for predicting An and g from leaves of C4 plants that is easily parameterised and that predicts many of the important environmental responses.     We derive the leaf model from a simple biochemical-intercellular transport model of C4 photosynthesis that includes inorganic carbon fixation by PEP carboxylase, light dependent generation of PEP and RuBP, rubisco reaction kinetics, and the diffusion of inorganic carbon and O2 between the bundle sheath and mesophyll. We argue that under most conditions these processes can be described simply as three potentially limiting steps. The leaf photosynthesis model treats An as first order with respect to either light, CO2 or the amount of rubisco present and produces a continuous transition between limitations. The independent variables of the leaf photosynthesis model are leaf temperature (TI), intercellular CO2 levels and the absorbed quantum flux.     A simple linear model of g in terms of An and leaf surface CO2 level (ps) and relative humidity (hs) is combined with the photosynthesis model to give leaf photosynthesis as a function of absorbed quantum flux, T1 and ps and hs levels.     Gas exchange measurements from corn leaves exposed to varied light, CO2 and temperature levels are used to parameterise and test the models. Model parameters are determined by fitting the models to a set of 21 measurements. The behaviour of the models is compared with an independent set of 71 measurements, and the predictions are shown to be highly correlated with the data.     Under most conditions the leaf model can be parameterised simply by determining the level of rubisco in the leaves. The effects of light environment, nutritional status and water stress levels on An and g can be accounted for by appropriate adjustment of the capacity for rubisco to fix CO2. We estimate rubsico capacity from CO2 and light saturated photosynthesis although leaf nitrogen content or rubisco assays from leaf extracts could also be used for this purpose.},

abstract = {This paper presents a system of models for the simulation of gas and energy exchange of a leaf of a C3 plant in free air. The physiological processes are simulated by sub-models that: (a) give net photosynthesis (An) as a function of environmental and leaf parameters and stomatal conductance (gs); (b) give g, as a function of the concentration of CO2 and H2O in air at the leaf surface and the current rate of photosynthesis of the leaf. An energy balance and mass transport sub-model is used to couple the physiological processes through a variable boundary layer to the ambient environment. The models are based on theoretical and empirical analysis of gs, and An measured at the leaf level, and tests with intact attached leaves of soybeans show very good agreement between predicted and measured responses of gs and An over a wide range of leaf temperatures (20–35°C), CO2 concentrations (10–90 Pa), air to leaf water vapor deficits (0.5–3.7 kPa) and light intensities (100–2000 $\mu$mol m−2s−1). The combined models were used to simulate the responses of latent heat flux ($\lambda$E) and gs for a soybean canopy for the course of an idealized summer day, using the ‘big-leaf' approximation. Appropriate data are not yet available to provide a rigorous test of these simulations, but the response patterns are similar to field observations. These simulations show a pronounced midday depression of $\lambda$E and gs at low or high values of boundary-layer conductance. Deterioration of plant water relations during midday has often been invoked to explain this common natural phenomenon, but the present models do not consider this possibility. Analysis of the model indicates that the simulated midday depression is, in part, the result of positive feedback mediated by the boundary layer. For example, a change in gs affects An and $\lambda$E. As a consequence, the temperature, humidity and CO2 concentration of the air in the proximity of the stomata (e.g. the air at the leaf surface) change and these, in turn, affect gs. The simulations illustrate the possible significance of the boundary layer in mediating feedback loops which affect the regulation of stomatal conductance and $\lambda$E. The simulations also examine the significance of changing the response properties of the photosynthetic component of the model by changing leaf protein content or the CO2 concentration of the atmosphere.},

abstract = {In this study, measurements of solar induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) at 760 nm (F760) are combined with hyperspectral reflectance (R) measurements collected in the field over agricultural crops in order to better understand the fluorescence (ChlF) signal of the vegetation. The ‘Soil-Canopy Observation Photosynthesis and Energy fluxes' (SCOPE) model, which combines radiative transfer and enzyme kinetics of photosynthesis with turbulent heat exchange in vegetation canopies, was partly inverted to obtain model parameters from R taken over healthy (unstressed) crops during the growing season. Reflectance spectra between 400 and 900 nm obtained at midday on different days in the growing season were used to obtain pigment concentrations, leaf area index and leaf inclination. These parameters were then used to simulate diurnal cycles of half-hourly ChlF spectra, using measured weather variables as input. Three scenarios were simulated: (i) a constant emission efficiency of ChlF (at the photosystem level), (ii) a variable emission efficiency calculated per half hour with an electron transport, photosynthesis and ChlF model for the photosystem, and (iii) a constant emission efficiency that was set to a theoretical maximum value for fully blocked photochemical electron transport of photosystem II and minimal non-photochemical quenching. The simulations of the first two scenarios were compared to ChlF retrieved from field measurements in the O2-A band with the spectral fitting method in unstressed rice and alfalfa. This comparison and a sensitivity analysis showed that SCOPE reproduces most of the seasonal variability of SIF after tuning to R even if the ChlF emission efficiency is kept constant, and F760values are mostly determined by chlorophyll content, dry matter, senescent material and leaf area and leaf inclination, whereas leaf water and carotenoid content had small effects. Diurnal variations in the ChlF emission efficiency at photosystem level were small in these crops. The simulations of the third scenario were compared to measurements of grass that was treated chemically to block electron transport and to provoke maximum ChlF. This comparison showed that the observed increase in F760can indeed be explained by a change in the ChlF emission efficiency at the photosystem level. It is concluded that hyperspectral reflectance and the ChlF signal together can reveal both the dynamics of vegetation structure and functioning.},

abstract = {This paper presents the model SCOPE (Soil Canopy Observation, Photochemistry and Energy fluxes), which is a vertical (1-D) integrated radiative transfer and en- ergy balance model. The model links visible to thermal in- frared radiance spectra (0.4 to 50 µm) as observed above the canopy to the fluxes of water, heat and carbon dioxide, as a function of vegetation structure, and the vertical profiles of temperature. Output of the model is the spectrum of outgo- ing radiation in the viewing direction and the turbulent heat fluxes, photosynthesis and chlorophyll fluorescence. A spe- cial routine is dedicated to the calculation of photosynthesis rate and chlorophyll fluorescence at the leaf level as a func- tion of net radiation and leaf temperature. The fluorescence contributions from individual leaves are integrated over the canopy layer to calculate top-of-canopy fluorescence. The calculation of radiative transfer and the energy balance is fully integrated, allowing for feedback between leaf tempera- tures, leaf chlorophyll fluorescence and radiative fluxes. Leaf temperatures are calculated on the basis of energy balance closure. Model simulations were evaluated against observa- tions reported in the literature and against data collected dur- ing field campaigns. These evaluations showed that SCOPE is able to reproduce realistic radiance spectra, directional ra- diance and energy balance fluxes. The model may be applied for the design of algorithms for the retrieval of evapotranspi- ration from optical and thermal earth observation data, for validation of existing methods to monitor vegetation func- tioning, to help interpret canopy fluorescence measurements, and to study the relationships between synoptic observations with diurnally integrated quantities. The model has been im- plemented in Matlab and has amodular design, thus allowing for great flexibility and scalability},

We describe the evolution and improvements of PROSPECT-D compared to the previous versions, and perform a validation on various experimental datasets. Our results show that PROSPECT-D outperforms all the previous versions. Model prediction uncertainty is decreased and photosynthetic pigments are better retrieved. This is particularly the case for leaf carotenoids, the estimation of which is particularly challenging. PROSPECT-D is also able to simulate realistic leaf optical properties with minimal error in the visible domain, and similar performances to other versions in the near infrared and shortwave infrared domains.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

The existing PROSPECT model and its concept of a compact leaf are used as a starting point, and the differential equations for radiative transfer within the leaf are solved by an efficient doubling algorithm. Due to the simplicity of these equations, Fluspect offers a high computational speed. With incident light provided as the main input parameter, Fluspect calculates the emission of ChlF on both the illuminated and shaded side of the leaf. Other input parameters are chlorophyll and carotenoid concentrations, leaf water, dry matter and senescent material (brown pigments) content, leaf mesophyll structure parameter and ChlF quantum efficiency for the two photosystems, PS-I and PS-II. We investigated the model performance using measurements of leaf reflectance, transmittance and ChlF spectra, collected for barley and sugar beet leaves in both a laboratory and outdoors setting. The plants had been grown under various illumination conditions to increase between-leaf variability of leaf biochemical and structural properties. We retrieved the model parameters, compared them to corresponding destructive measurements and finally, used them to simulate ChlF on either side of the leaf at several light intensities. The results show that the model reproduces observed SIF accurately, especially for leaves measured under natural illumination. Most of the observed between-leaf variability of ChlF could be explained from differences in leaf biochemical and structural properties, with potential additional information held by ChlF emission efficiency parameters.},

abstract = {Various aspects of the biochemistry of photosynthetic carbon assimilation in C3 plants are integrated into a form compatible with studies of gas exchange in leaves. These aspects include the kinetic properties of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase- oxygenase; the requirements of the photosynthetic carbon reduction and photorespiratory carbon oxida- tion cycles for reduced pyridine nucleotides; the de- pendence of electron transport on photon flux and the presence of a temperature dependent upper limit to electron transport. The measurements of gas ex- change with which the model outputs may be com- pared include those of the temperature and partial pressure of CO2(p(CO2) ) dependencies of quantum yield, the variation of compensation point with tem- perature and partial pressure of O2(p(O2)), the de- pendence of net CO 2 assimilation rate on p(CO2) and irradiance, and the influence of p(CO2) and ir- radiance on the temperature dependence of assimi- lation rate.},

abstract = {The remote sensing community puts major efforts into calibration and validation of sensors, measurements, and derived products to quantify and reduce uncertainties. Given recent advances in instrument design, radiometric calibration, atmospheric correction, algorithm development, product development, validation, and delivery, the lack of standardization of reflectance terminology and products becomes a considerable source of error. This article provides full access to the basic concept and definitions of reflectance quantities, as given by Nicodemus et al. [Nicodemus, F.E., Richmond, J.C., Hsia, J.J., Ginsberg, I.W., and Limperis, T. (1977). Geometrical Considerations and Nomenclature for Reflectance. In: National Bureau of Standards, US Department of Commerce, Washington, D.C. URL: http://physics.nist.gov/Divisions/Div844/facilities/specphoto/pdf/geoConsid.pdf.] and Martonchik et al. [Martonchik, J.V., Bruegge, C.J., and Strahler, A. (2000). A review of reflectance nomenclature used in remote sensing. Remote Sensing Reviews, 19, 9-20.]. Reflectance terms such as BRDF, HDRF, BRF, BHR, DHR, black-sky albedo, white-sky albedo, and blue-sky albedo are defined, explained, and exemplified, while separating conceptual from measurable quantities. We use selected examples from the peer-reviewed literature to demonstrate that very often the current use of reflectance terminology does not fulfill physical standards and can lead to systematic errors. Secondly, the paper highlights the importance of a proper usage of definitions through quantitative comparison of different reflectance products with special emphasis on wavelength dependent effects. Reflectance quantities acquired under hemispherical illumination conditions (i.e., all outdoor measurements) depend not only on the scattering properties of the observed surface, but as well on atmospheric conditions, the object's surroundings, and the topography, with distinct expression of these effects in different wavelengths. We exemplify differences between the hemispherical and directional illumination quantities, based on observations (i.e., MISR), and on reflectance simulations of natural surfaces (i.e., vegetation canopy and snow cover). In order to improve the current situation of frequent ambiguous usage of reflectance terms and quantities, we suggest standardizing the terminology in reflectance product descriptions and that the community carefully utilizes the proposed reflectance terminology in scientific publications. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.
